Islands in the stream. That is what we are
You've got to know when to hold them
I've been to paradise but I've never been to me
I would do anything for love. But I won't do that
We've only just begun
I can't stop these dancing feet
I believe I can fly
I feel it in my fingers
This is how we do it
I want to know what love is
It's not unusual
Madness. They call it madness
Breaking the law. Breaking the law
Take it{comma} to the limit
Highway to the danger zone
r e s p e c t.  find out what it means to me
tell me what's the word. the word up
Lend me some sugar. I am your neighbour
Shake it like a Polaroid picture
I'll take your brain to another dimension
Pay close attention
There's no limit
Techno techno techno techno
I'm a fire starter. Twisted fire starter
Right about now. The funk soul brother
I like to move it move it
What's your flavour. Tell me what's your flavour
Pump up the jam. Pump it up
Stop, collaborate and listen
Check out the hook while my DJ revolves it
Wibbly wobbly woo. You knows what to do
Let's get ready ready Let's get ready ready Let's get ready to rumble
Insane in the membrane
It's a sad sad situation
I feel it in my fingers
I can't fight this feeling any more
I'm hooked on a feeling
